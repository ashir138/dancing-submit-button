# 💃 Dancing Submit Button (Form Validation Mini Project)

This is a fun and interactive mini-project where the **submit button dances away** (moves left/right) if the user hasn’t entered valid input. It's a creative take on client-side form validation using JavaScript.

## 🧠 What It Does

- Validates the **username** using regex: must be at least 4 characters and start with a letter.
- Validates the **password** for at least:
  - One uppercase letter
  - One lowercase letter
  - One number
  - Minimum 8 characters
- If either input is invalid, the **Submit button escapes on hover** (left/right shift).
- Once both inputs are valid, the button stays still and allows clicking.
- Displays a success message after valid submission.
